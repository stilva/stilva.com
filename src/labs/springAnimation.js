      content: `For most CSS animations, I usually use \`@keyframes\` when there's no interaction, and CSS \`transition\` when there's user interaction.
This obviously isn't always applicable but for most part, \`transition\`'s ability to animate from an arbitrary value works better for interactions.

However, \`transition\` has its own constraint: \`transition-duration\`. For example, a page transition tailored to small screen, won't always feel as nice and smooth on a larger screen. Dynamically tweaking the \`transition-duration\` with some JS with added velocity is usually my lightweight go-to solution.

On React apps, when you can afford adding around \`10kB\` gzipped JS, you can reach out for libraries such as \`react-spring\` (or the original, and smaller \`react-motion\`). For my little lightweight website \`10kB\` is unfortunately way too much.`

* configurability of mass, tension, friction etc
* \`Animated.div\` Component with a declarative API, but a direct DOM manipulation behind the scene.
* hooks API such as \`useSpring(animationProperties, springConfig)\`

Additionally just like \`react-spring\` and \`emotionjs\`, I want the ability to have the short-hand notation of \`&lt;Animated.div /&gt;\` over \`&lt;Animated type="div" /&gt;\`.`
