      <p>
        Since late 2015 firstborn has been handling a lot of Supercell's non-game web presence, with project such as
        Clash of clans' website, clash royale's blog site, supercell's merchandise e-commerce store etc. Starting with
        Supercell's Boombeach game, we got the chance to be in charge of building their in-game news platform (hereon
        "inboxes").
      </p>
      <p>
        In late 2018, we've built an e-sport fantasy deck submission platform which amassed 6M+ submissions form gamers
        around the world.

      <h2 className="blob__title">My role /</h2>
      <p>
        Almost from day one, I've been involved with a lot of the projects with Supercell, as a front-end lead.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've successfully lead the front-end development for the internationalisation of the Clash Royale blog, followed
        by the Clash of Clans website, our first in-game news platform, the shopify based e-commerce website along
        multiple developer tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was also in charge of building the backend (AWS lambda) for a campaign to generate custom videos for millions
        of users. In 2018, I built the front-end for an e-sport fantasy deck submission, which gathered 6M+ votes within
        2 weeks.

      <h2 className="blob__title">Tech notes /</h2>

      <p>
        I've chosen preact over react in many of the projects, due to its smaller foot-print. For the same reasons I've
        picked Rollup as our go-to bundler for the inboxes. All front-end unit tests were written with jest.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the e-commerce website, I've written a lot of custom tools for better DX with shopify â€“ a per-developer
        theme deployment system, CI server theme push with history, better browser reload with Shopify etc.
