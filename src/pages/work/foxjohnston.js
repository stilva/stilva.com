    <h1>Fox Johnston</h1>
    <h2>Overview /</h2>
    <p>
      Coming off of Flash, this was one of my first few HTML/CSS/Javascript project while at Canvas Group in Sydney. The
      CMS was wordpress with podsCMS, along a custom plugin to output everything as JSON.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cuf√≥n was used for the webfonts, Objs was used to reflect the MVC architecture from my Flash projects, LESS for
      the stylesheets etc. The usual libraries such as jQuery, modernizr, and a tweening engine were also used.
