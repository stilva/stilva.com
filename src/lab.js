        content: `In adding entries to this lab, I realised I needed an inline link component. However, that would have complicated my JSON like data structure. Instead, I decided to build a small markdown component, so I could write my articles in markdown, and publish them.

It's on github: [@stilva/markdown](https://www.github.com/stilva/markdown), check it out.

There's a few performance tests I'd like to run:
* What are the performance implications in creating DOM elements vs building string representations and using \`dangerouslySetInnerHTML\`
* Same for using createElement as a building block (I'm not convinced there's much to gain by converting the input as actual react components, given the static nature of markdowns)
* Avoiding regexp, and having a more abstract representation of the markdown. e.g. new Node(), new Leaf()

I initially had decided to use RegExp to keep the code simple, and to worry about performance when needed.
The only performance optimisation I have done this far, is to cache the rendered HTML string in the SessionStorage.
At the moment the only way to invalidate it is by passing a new key.`

Having had to go through the whole ceremony on more than one occasion in the last few months, I've decided to finally write a small library to ease the pain.
This is based on code from back in 2016, and I've updated it to use the template literals so it looks nicer.
